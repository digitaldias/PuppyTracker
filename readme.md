# Puppy Tracker v1.0
A successfull puppy means a puppy that is settled with routine and consistent feeding and toilet times. 

This project is all about tracking your puppy's logistics, feeding, pooping and peeing and crate training times to make it easier to learn the statistics of YOUR puppy. 

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to learn Angular, to deploy it to a Raspberry Pi 4 with a touch-screen. It will serve as a data-gathering point located close to the puppy's crate. Backed by an Asp.Net core backend, the data is gathered and posted to an Azure Storage table for reporting in Excel and/or PowerBI.
