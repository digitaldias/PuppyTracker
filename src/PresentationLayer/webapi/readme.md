# Technical description for PuppyApi
These notes follow [this blogpost](https://dev.to/dileno/build-a-simple-crud-app-with-angular-8-and-asp-net-core-2-2-part-1-back-end-39e1) for setting up a general WebApi to handle blogposts. It is well written, but I will stray from it fairly early. 

Make sure that you've instaled Visual Studio 2019 or newer. 
Once installed, start it, and create a new project: 

* Project Type is C# AspNet Core WebApp
* Choose the **API** Template. I named my project '**PuppyApi**'
* Select 'Place solution in same folder' to keep things organized
