# Technical description for PuppyApi
Make sure that you've instaled Visual Studio 2019 or newer. 
Once installed, start it, and create a new project: 

* Project Type is C# AspNet Core WebApp
* Choose the **API** Template. I named my project '**PuppyApi**'
* Select 'Place solution in same folder' to keep things organized
